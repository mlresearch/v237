title: Corruption-Robust Lipschitz Contextual Search
abstract: 'I study the problem of learning a Lipschitz function with corrupted binary
  signals. The learner tries to learn a $L$-Lipschitz function $f: [0,1]^d \rightarrow
  [0, L]$ that the adversary chooses. There is a total of $T$ rounds. In each round
  $t$, the adversary selects a context vector $x_t$ in the input space, and the learner
  makes a guess to the true function value $f(x_t)$ and receives a binary signal indicating
  whether the guess is high or low. In a total of $C$ rounds, the signal may be corrupted,
  though the value of $C$ is unknown to the learner. The learnerâ€™s goal is to incur
  a small cumulative loss. This work introduces the new algorithmic technique agnostic
  checking as well as new analysis techniques. I design algorithms which: for the
  absolute loss, the learner achieves regret $L\cdot O(C\log T)$ when $d = 1$ and
  $L\cdot O_d(C\log T + T^{(d-1)/d})$ when $d > 1$; for the pricing loss, the learner
  achieves regret $L\cdot \widetilde{O} (T^{d/(d+1)} + C\cdot T^{1/(d+1)})$. '
