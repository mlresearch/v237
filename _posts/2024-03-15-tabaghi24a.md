title: Universal Representation of Permutation-Invariant Functions on Vectors and
  Tensors
abstract: A main object of our study is multiset functions — that is, permutation-invariant
  functions over inputs of varying sizes. Deep Sets, proposed by Zaheer et al. (2017),
  provides a universal representation for continuous multiset functions on scalars
  via a sum-decomposable model. Restricting the domain of the functions to finite
  multisets of $D$-dimensional vectors, Deep Sets also provides a universal approximation
  that requires a latent space dimension of $O(N^D)$ — where $N$ is an upper bound
  on the size of input multisets. In this paper, we strengthen this result by proving
  that universal representation is guaranteed for continuous and discontinuous multiset
  functions through a latent space dimension of $O(N^D)$ (which we will further improve
  upon). We then introduce identifiable multisets for which we can uniquely label
  their elements using an identifier function, namely, finite-precision vectors are
  identifiable. Based on our analysis of identifiable multisets, we prove that a sum-decomposable
  model, for general continuous multiset functions requires only a latent dimension
  of $2DN$, as opposed to $O(N^D)$. We further show that both encoder and decoder
  functions of the model are continuous — our main contribution to the existing work
  which lacks such a guarantee. Additionally, this provides a significant improvement
  over the aforementioned $O(N^D)$ bound, derived for the universal representation
  of both continuous and discontinuous multiset functions. We then extend our results
  and provide special sum-decomposition structures to universally represent permutation-invariant
  tensor functions on identifiable tensors. These families of sum-decomposition models
  enable us to design deep network architectures and deploy them on a variety of learning
  tasks on sequences, images, and graphs.
