title: Tight Bounds for Local Glivenko-Cantelli
abstract: This paper addresses the statistical problem of estimating the infinite-norm
  deviation from the empirical mean to the distribution mean for high-dimensional
  distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$, potentially with $d=\infty$. Unlike traditional bounds
  as in the classical Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, we explore the instance-dependent
  convergence behavior. For product distributions, we provide the exact non-asymptotic
  behavior of the expected maximum deviation, revealing various regimes of decay.
  In particular, these tight bounds demonstrate the necessity of a previously proposed
  factor for an upper bound, answering a corresponding COLT 2023 open problem (Cohen
  and Kontorovich, 2022, 2023). We also consider general distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$
  and provide the tightest possible bounds for the maximum deviation of the empirical
  mean given only the mean statistic. Along the way, we prove a localized version
  of the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality. Additionally, we present some results
  for two other cases, one where the deviation is measured in some $q$-norm, and the
  other where the distribution is supported on a continuous domain $[0,1]^d$, and
  also provide some high-probability bounds for the maximum deviation in the independent
  Bernoulli case.
