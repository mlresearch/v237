title: Adversarial Contextual Bandits Go Kernelized
abstract: We study a generalization of the problem of online learning in adversarial
  linear contextual bandits by incorporating loss functions that belong to a reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space, which allows for a more flexible modeling of complex decision-making
  scenarios. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that makes use of a
  new optimistically biased estimator for the loss functions and achieves near-optimal
  regret guarantees under a variety of eigenvalue decay assumptions made on the underlying
  kernel. Specifically, under the assumption of polynomial eigendecay with exponentÂ $c>1$,
  the regret is $\tilde O(KT^{\frac{1}{2}\pa{1+\frac{1}{c}}})$, where $T$ denotes
  the number of rounds and $K$ the number of actions. Furthermore, when the eigendecay
  follows an exponential pattern, we achieve an even tighter regret bound of $\tOO(\sqrt{T})$.
  These rates match the lower bounds in all special cases where lower bounds are known
  at all, and match the best known upper bounds available for the more well-studied
  stochastic counterpart of our problem.
