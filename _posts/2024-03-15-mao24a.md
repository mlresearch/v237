title: 'Predictor-Rejector Multi-Class Abstention: Theoretical Analysis and Algorithms'
abstract: We study the key framework of learning with abstention in the multi-class
  classification setting. In this setting, the learner can choose to abstain from
  making a prediction with some pre-defined cost. We present a series of new theoretical
  and algorithmic results for this learning problem in the predictor-rejector framework.
  We introduce several new families of surrogate losses for which we prove strong
  non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, thereby resolving
  positively two existing open questions. These guarantees provide upper bounds on
  the estimation error of the abstention loss function in terms of that of the surrogate
  loss. We analyze both a single-stage setting where the predictor and rejector are
  learned simultaneously and a two-stage setting crucial in applications, where the
  predictor is learned in a first stage using a standard surrogate loss such as cross-entropy.
  These guarantees suggest new multi-class abstention algorithms based on minimizing
  these surrogate losses. We also report the results of extensive experiments comparing
  these algorithms to the current state-of-the-art algorithms on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
  and SVHN datasets. Our results demonstrate empirically the benefit of our new surrogate
  losses and show the remarkable performance of our broadly applicable two-stage abstention
  algorithm.
