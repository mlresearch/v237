title: 'Agnostic Membership Query Learning with Nontrivial Savings: New Results and
  Techniques'
abstract: 'Designing computationally efficient algorithms in the agnostic learning
  model (Haussler, 1992; Kearns et al., 1994) is notoriously difficult. In this work,
  we consider agnostic learning with membership queries for touchstone classes at
  the frontier of agnostic learning, with a focus on how much computation can be saved
  over the trivial run-time of $2^n$. This approach is inspired by and continues the
  study of “learning with nontrivial savings” (Servedio and Tan, 2017). To this end,
  we establish multiple agnostic learning algorithms, highlighted by: <ul><li>An agnostic
  learning algorithm for circuits consisting of a sublinear number of gates, which
  can each be any function computable by a sublogarithmic degree $k$ polynomial threshold
  function (the depth of the circuit is bounded only by size). This algorithm runs
  in time $2^{n -s(n)}$ for $s(n) \approx n/(k+1)$, and learns over the uniform distribution
  over unlabelled examples on $\{0,1\}^n$.</li> <li>An agnostic learning algorithm
  for circuits consisting of a sublinear number of gates, where each can be any function
  computable by a $\sym^+$ circuit of subexponential size and sublogarithmic degree
  $k$. This algorithm runs in time $2^{n-s(n)}$ for $s(n) \approx n/(k+1)$, and learns
  over distributions of unlabelled examples that are products of $k+1$ \textit{arbitrary
  and unknown} distributions, each over $\{0,1\}^{n/(k+1)}$ (assume without loss of
  generality that $k+1$ divides $n$).</li></ul> Furthermore, we apply our new agnostic
  learning algorithms for these classes to also obtain algorithms for randomized compression,
  exact learning with membership and equivalence queries, and distribution-independent
  PAC-learning with membership queries. Our core technique, which may be of independent
  interest, remixes the learning from natural proofs paradigm (Carmosino et al. 2016,
  2017), so that we can tolerate concept classes fundamentally different than $\AC^0[p]$,
  and achieve fully agnostic learning. We make use of communication-complexity-based
  natural proofs (Nisan, 1993), rather than natural proofs of Razborov (1987) and
  Smolensky (1987) for $\AC^0[p]$.'
