title: Distances for Markov Chains, and Their Differentiation
abstract: "(Directed) graphs with node attributes are a common type of data in various
  applications and there is a vast literature on developing metrics and efficient
  algorithms for comparing them. Recently, in the graph learning and optimization
  communities, a range of new approaches have been developed for comparing graphs
  with node attributes, leveraging ideas such as the Optimal Transport (OT) and the
  Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test. Two state-of-the-art representatives
  are the OTC distance proposed in (O’Connor et al., 2022) and the WL distance in
  (Chen et al., 2022). Interestingly, while these two distances are developed based
  on different ideas, we observe that they both view graphs as Markov chains, and
  are deeply connected.  Indeed, in this paper, we propose a unified framework to
  generate distances for Markov chains (thus including (directed) graphs with node
  attributes), which we call the <em>Optimal Transport Markov (OTM)</em> distances,
  that encompass both the OTC and the WL distances. We further introduce a special
  one-parameter family of distances within our OTM framework, called the <em>discounted
  WL distance</em>. We show that the discounted WL distance has nice theoretical properties
  and can address several limitations of the existing OTC and WL distances. Furthermore,
  contrary to the OTC and the WL distances, our new discounted WL distance can be
  differentiated after a entropy-regularization similar to the Sinkhorn distance,
  making it suitable to use in learning frameworks, e.g., as the reconstruction loss
  in a graph generative model."
