title: Private PAC Learning May be Harder than Online Learning
abstract: We continue the study of the computational complexity of differentially
  private PAC learning and how it is situated within the foundations of machine learning.
  A recent line of work uncovered a qualitative equivalence between the private PAC
  model and Littlestoneâ€™s mistake-bounded model of online learning, in particular,
  showing that any concept class of Littlestone dimension $d$ can be privately PAC
  learned using $\operatorname{poly}(d)$ samples. This raises the natural question
  of whether there might be a generic conversion from online learners to private PAC
  learners that also preserves computational efficiency. We give a negative answer
  to this question under reasonable cryptographic assumptions (roughly, those from
  which it is possible to build indistinguishability obfuscation for all circuits).
  We exhibit a concept class that admits an online learner running in polynomial time
  with a polynomial mistake bound, but for which there is no computationally-efficient
  differentially private PAC learner. Our construction and analysis strengthens and
  generalizes that of Bun and Zhandry (TCC 2016-A), who established such a separation
  between private and non-private PAC learner.
