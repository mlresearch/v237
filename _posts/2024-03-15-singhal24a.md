title: A Polynomial Time, Pure Differentially Private Estimator for Binary Product
  Distributions
abstract: We present the first $\varepsilon$-differentially private, computationally
  efficient algorithm that estimates the means of product distributions over $\{0,1\}^d$
  accurately in total-variation distance, whilst attaining the optimal sample complexity
  to within polylogarithmic factors. The prior work had either solved this problem
  efficiently and optimally under weaker notions of privacy, or had solved it optimally
  while having exponential running times.
