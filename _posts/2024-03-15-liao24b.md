title: Learning Spanning Forests Optimally in Weighted Undirected Graphs with CUT
  queries
abstract: In this paper we describe a randomized algorithm which returns a maximal
  spanning forest of an unknown {\em weighted} undirected graph making  $O(n)$ $\mathsf{CUT}$
  queries in expectation. For weighted graphs, this is optimal due to a result in
  [Auza and Lee, 2021] which shows an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound for zero-error randomized
  algorithms. These questions have been extensively studied in the past few years,
  especially due to the problemâ€™s connections to symmetric submodular function minimization.
  We also describe a simple polynomial time deterministic algorithm that makes $O(\frac{n\log
  n}{\log\log n})$ queries on undirected unweighted graphs and returns a maximal spanning
  forest, thereby (slightly) improving upon the state-of-the-art.
