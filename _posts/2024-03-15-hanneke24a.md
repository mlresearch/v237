title: Efficient Agnostic Learning with Average Smoothness
abstract: We study distribution-free nonparametric regression following a notion of
  average smoothness initiated by Ashlagi et al. (2021), which measures the “effective”
  smoothness of a function with respect to an arbitrary unknown underlying distribution.  While
  the recent work of Hanneke et al. (2023) established tight uniform convergence bounds
  for average-smooth functions in the realizable case and provided a computationally
  efficient realizable learning algorithm, both of these results currently lack analogs
  in the general agnostic (i.e. noisy) case. In this work, we fully close these gaps.
  First, we provide a distribution-free uniform convergence bound for average-smoothness
  classes in the agnostic setting. Second, we match the derived sample complexity
  with a computationally efficient agnostic learning algorithm. Our results, which
  are stated in terms of the intrinsic geometry of the data and hold over any totally
  bounded metric space, show that the guarantees recently obtained for realizable
  learning of average-smooth functions transfer to the agnostic setting. At the heart
  of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence rate of a function class in terms
  of its bracketing entropy, which may be of independent interest.
