title: Partially Interpretable Models with Guarantees on Coverage and Accuracy
abstract: Simple, sufficient explanations furnished by short decision lists can be
  useful for guiding stakeholder actions. Unfortunately, this transparency can come
  at the expense of the higher accuracy enjoyed by black box methods, like deep nets.
  To date, practitioners typically either (i) insist on the simpler model, forsaking
  accuracy; or (ii) insist on maximizing accuracy, settling for post-hoc explanations
  of dubious faithfulness. In this paper, we propose a hybrid partially interpretable
  model that represents a compromise between the two extremes. In our setup, each
  input is first processed by a decision list that can either execute a decision or
  abstain,  handing off authority to the opaque model.  The key to optimizing the
  decision list is to optimally trade off the accuracy of the composite system against
  coverage (the fraction of the population that receives explanations). We contribute
  a new principled algorithm for constructing partially interpretable decision lists,
  providing theoretical guarantees addressing both interpretability and accuracy.
  As an instance of our result, we prove that when the optimal decision list has length
  $k$, coverage $c$, and $b$ mistakes, our algorithm will generate a decision list
  that has length no greater than $4k$, coverage at least $c/2$, and makes at most
  $4b$ mistakes. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the new model.
