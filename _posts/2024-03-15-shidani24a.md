title: Optimal Regret Bounds for Collaborative Learning in Bandits
abstract: We consider regret minimization in a general collaborative multi-agent multi-armed
  bandit model, in which each agent faces a finite set of arms and may communicate
  with other agents through a central controller. The optimal arm for each agent in
  this model is the arm with the largest expected <em>mixed<em> reward, where the
  mixed reward of each arm is a weighted average of its rewards across all agents,
  making communication among agents crucial. While near-optimal sample complexities
  for best arm identification are known under this collaborative model, the question
  of optimal regret remains open. In this work, we address this problem and propose
  the first algorithm with order optimal regret bounds under this collaborative bandit
  model. Furthermore, we show that only a small constant number of expected communication
  rounds is needed.
