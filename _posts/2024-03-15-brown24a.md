title: Online Recommendations for Agents with Discounted Adaptive Preferences
abstract: We consider a bandit recommendations problem in which an agent’s preferences
  (representing selection probabilities over recommended items) evolve as a function
  of past selections, according to an unknown \textit{preference model}. In each round,
  we show a menu of $k$ items (out of $n$ total) to the agent, who then chooses a
  single item, and we aim to minimize regret with respect to some \textit{target set}
  (a subset of the item simplex) for adversarial losses over the agent’s choices.
  Extending the setting from \cite{AgarwalB22}, where uniform-memory agents were considered,
  here we allow for non-uniform memory in which a discount factor is applied to the
  agent’s memory vector at each subsequent round. In the “long-term memory” regime
  (when the effective memory horizon scales with $T$ sublinearly), we show that efficient
  sublinear regret is obtainable with respect to the set of \textit{everywhere instantaneously
  realizable distributions} (the “EIRD set”, as formulated in prior work) for any
  \textit{smooth} preference model. Further, for preferences which are bounded above
  and below by linear functions of memory weight (we call these “scale-bounded” preferences)
  we give an algorithm which obtains efficient sublinear regret with respect to nearly
  the \textit{entire} item simplex. We show an NP-hardness result for expanding to
  targets beyond EIRD in general. In the “short-term memory” regime (when the memory
  horizon is constant), we show that scale-bounded preferences again enable efficient
  sublinear regret for nearly the entire simplex even without smoothness if losses
  do not change too frequently, yet we show an information-theoretic barrier for competing
  against the EIRD set under arbitrary smooth preference models even when losses are
  constant.
