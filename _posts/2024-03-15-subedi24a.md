title: 'Online Infinite-Dimensional Regression: Learning Linear Operators'
abstract: We consider the problem of learning linear operators under squared loss
  between two infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces in the online setting. We show that
  the class of linear operators with uniformly bounded $p$-Schatten norm is online
  learnable for any $p \in [1, \infty)$. On the other hand, we prove an impossibility
  result by showing that the class of uniformly bounded linear operators with respect
  to the operator norm is \textit{not} online learnable. Moreover, we show a separation
  between sequential uniform convergence and online learnability by identifying a
  class of bounded linear operators that is online learnable but uniform convergence
  does not hold. Finally, we prove that the impossibility result and the separation
  between uniform convergence and learnability also hold in the batch setting.
