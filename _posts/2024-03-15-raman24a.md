title: Multiclass Online Learnability under Bandit Feedback
abstract: We study online multiclass classification under bandit feedback. We extend
  the results of Daniely and Helbertal [2013] by showing that the finiteness of the
  Bandit Littlestone dimension is necessary and sufficient for bandit online learnability
  even when the label space is unbounded. Moreover, we show that, unlike the full-information
  setting, sequential uniform convergence is necessary but not sufficient for bandit
  online learnability. Our result complements the recent work by Hanneke, Moran, Raman,
  Subedi, and Tewari [2023] who show that the Littlestone dimension characterizes
  online multiclass learnability in the full-information setting even when the label
  space is unbounded.
