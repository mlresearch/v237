title: 'Adaptive Combinatorial Maximization: Beyond Approximate Greedy Policies'
abstract: We study adaptive combinatorial maximization, which is a core challenge
  in machine learning, with applications in active learning as well as many other
  domains.  We study the Bayesian setting, and consider the objectives of maximization
  under a cardinality constraint and minimum cost coverage.  We provide new comprehensive
  approximation guarantees that subsume previous results, as well as considerably
  strengthen them.  Our approximation guarantees simultaneously support the maximal
  gain ratio as well as near-submodular utility functions,  and include both maximization
  under a cardinality constraint and a minimum cost coverage guarantee.  In addition,
  we provided an approximation guarantee for a modified prior, which is crucial for
  obtaining active learning guarantees that do not depend on the smallest probability
  in the prior. Moreover, we discover a new parameter of adaptive selection policies,
  which we term the maximal gain ratio.  We show that this parameter is strictly less
  restrictive than the greedy approximation parameter that has been used in previous
  approximation guarantees,  and show that it can be used to provide stronger approximation
  guarantees than previous results.  In particular, we show that the maximal gain
  ratio is never larger than the greedy approximation factor of a policy, and that
  it can be considerably smaller.  This provides a new insight into the properties
  that make a policy useful for adaptive combinatorial maximization.
