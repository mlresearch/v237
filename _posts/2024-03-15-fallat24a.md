title: Learning Hypertrees From Shortest Path Queries
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a labeled hypergraph from a given family
  of hypergraphs, using shortest path (SP) queries. An SP query specifies two vertices
  and asks for their distance in the target hypergraph. For various classes $\mathcal{H}$
  of hypertrees, we present bounds on the number of queries required to learn an unknown
  hypertree from $\mathcal{H}$. Matching upper and lower asymptotic bounds are presented
  for learning hyperpaths and hyperstars, both in the adaptive and in the non-adaptive
  setting. Moreover, two non-trivial classes of hypertrees are shown to be efficiently
  learnable from adaptive SP queries, under certain conditions on structural parameters.
