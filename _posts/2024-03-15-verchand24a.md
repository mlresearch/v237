title: 'Alternating minimization for generalized rank one matrix sensing: Sharp predictions
  from a random initialization'
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the factors of a rank-$1$ matrix with
  i.i.d. Gaussian, rank-$1$ measurements that are nonlinearly transformed and corrupted
  by noise. Considering two prototypical choices for the nonlinearity, we study the
  convergence properties of a natural alternating update rule for this nonconvex optimization
  problem starting from a random initialization. We show sharp convergence guarantees
  for a sample-split version of the algorithm by deriving a deterministic recursion
  that is accurate even in high-dimensional problems. Notably, while the infinite-sample
  population update is uninformative and suggests exact recovery in a single step,
  the algorithm—and our deterministic prediction—converges geometrically fast from
  a random initialization. Our sharp, non-asymptotic analysis also exposes several
  other fine-grained properties of this problem, including how the nonlinearity and
  noise level affect convergence behavior.\\{On} a technical level, our results are
  enabled by showing that the empirical error recursion can be predicted by our deterministic
  sequence within fluctuations of the order $n^{-1/2}$ when each iteration is run
  with $n$ observations. Our technique leverages leave-one-out tools originating in
  the literature on high-dimensional $M$-estimation and provides an avenue for sharply
  analyzing complex iterative algorithms from a random initialization in other high-dimensional
  optimization problems with random data.
