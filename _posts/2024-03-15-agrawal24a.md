title: 'CRIMED: Lower and Upper Bounds on Regret for Bandits with Unbounded Stochastic
  Corruption'
abstract: We investigate the regret-minimisation problem in a multi-armed bandit setting
  with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent receives rewards
  generated independently from the distribution of the arm chosen at each time. However,
  these rewards are not directly observed. Instead, with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$,
  the agent observes a sample from the chosen arm’s distribution with probability
  $1-\varepsilon$, or from an arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$.
  Importantly, we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can
  be unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions,
  we establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
  distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that achieves
  the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian distributions with known
  variance.  Additionally, we provide a finite-sample analysis of CRIMED’s regret
  performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle corruptions with $\varepsilon$
  values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we develop a tight concentration result
  for medians in the presence of arbitrary corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values
  up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be of independent interest. We also discuss an extension
  of the algorithm for handling misspecification in Gaussian model.
