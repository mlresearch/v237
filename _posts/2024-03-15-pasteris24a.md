title: Adversarial Online Collaborative Filtering
abstract: We investigate the problem of online collaborative filtering under no-repetition
  constraints, whereby users need to be served content in an online fashion and a
  given user cannot be recommended the same content item more than once. We start
  by designing and analyzing an algorithm that works under biclustering assumptions
  on the user-item preference matrix, and show that this algorithm exhibits an optimal
  regret guarantee, while being fully adaptive, in that it is oblivious to any prior
  knowledge about the sequence of users, the universe of items, as well as the biclustering
  parameters of the preference matrix. We then propose a more robust version of this
  algorithm which operates with general matrices. Also this algorithm is parameter
  free, and we prove regret guarantees that scale with the amount by which the preference
  matrix deviates from a biclustered structure. To our knowledge, these are the first
  results on online collaborative filtering that hold at this level of generality
  and adaptivity under no-repetition constraints. Finally, we complement our theoretical
  findings with simple experiments on real-world datasets aimed at both validating
  the theory and empirically comparing to standard baselines. This comparison shows
  the competitive advantage of our approach over these baselines.
