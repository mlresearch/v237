title: Learning bounded-degree polytrees with known skeleton
abstract: We establish finite-sample guarantees for efficient proper learning of bounded-degree
  {\em polytrees}, a rich class of high-dimensional probability distributions and
  a subclass of Bayesian networks, a widely-studied type of graphical model. Recently,
  Bhattacharyya et al. (2021) obtained finite-sample guarantees for recovering tree-structured
  Bayesian networks, i.e., 1-polytrees. We extend their results by providing an efficient
  algorithm which learns $d$-polytrees in polynomial time and sample complexity for
  any bounded $d$ when the underlying undirected graph (skeleton) is known. We complement
  our algorithm with an information-theoretic sample complexity lower bound, showing
  that the dependence on the dimension and target accuracy parameters are nearly tight.
