title: Not All Learnable Distribution Classes are Privately Learnable
abstract: We give an example of a class of distributions that is learnable in total
  variation distance with a finite number of samples, but not learnable under $(\varepsilon,
  \delta)$-differential privacy. This refutes a conjecture of Ashtiani.
