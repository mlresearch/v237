title: Concentration of empirical barycenters in metric spaces
abstract: Barycenters (aka Fréchet means) were introduced in statistics in the 1940’s
  and popularized in the fields of shape statistics and, later, in optimal transport
  and matrix analysis. They provide the most natural extension of linear averaging
  to non-Euclidean geometries, which is perhaps the most basic and widely used tool
  in data science. In various setups, their asymptotic properties, such as laws of
  large numbers and central limit theorems, have been established, but their non-asymptotic
  behaviour is still not well understood. In this work, we prove finite sample concentration
  inequalities (namely, generalizations of Hoeffding’s and Bernstein’s inequalities)
  for barycenters of i.i.d. random variables in metric spaces with non-positive curvature
  in Alexandrov’s sense. As a byproduct, we also obtain PAC guarantees for a stochastic
  online algorithm that computes the barycenter of a finite collection of points in
  a non-positively curved space. We also discuss extensions of our results to spaces
  with possibly positive curvature.
